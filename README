Hooks keyboard so the key press can be intercepted before being passed to any application.
Useful for disabling Windows Hot Keys (Ctrl + Alt + Del, Alt + Tab, etc).
Can be used to build a keylogger too ;)
The sample app won't run from within Visual Studio as it won't allow the app to add a hook.
Build the exe and run it seperately.
